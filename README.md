### Documentation for Travel Website

This document explains the structure and design of a basic travel website that uses HTML for the content and CSS for the layout and styling. The explanation is provided in simple terms to help beginners understand how the website is built.

### HTML Structure

The website is built using HTML, which structures the content on the page.

- **HTML Document Structure**: At the very beginning of the HTML file, we specify the document type (`<!DOCTYPE html>`) and the language (`lang="en"`) to ensure that the content is interpreted correctly by the browser. This is followed by the opening `<html>` tag.

- **Head Section**: Inside the `<head>` section, metadata such as character encoding, viewport settings (for responsive design), and links to external files (like the CSS stylesheet) are included. The title of the website, "TRAVEL WEBSITE", appears in the browser tab, and the link to the external CSS file (`hello.css`) allows the HTML to be styled.

- **Header Section**: The `<header>` section contains the navigation bar and logo. Inside this section, there is a logo image with a link to the homepage, followed by a menu of navigation links like "Home," "About," "Destinations," "Hotels," and "Contact." These links lead to different sections or pages of the website.

- **Hero Section**: The hero section is the large introductory area of the website that welcomes visitors. It usually includes a title (like "Welcome to Our Travel Website"), a brief description, and a "Book Now" button. This section is designed to catch the visitor's attention and encourage them to take action.

- **Destinations Section**: This section highlights popular travel destinations, such as New York City, Paris, and Tokyo. Each destination is presented with an image, a title, and a short description that explains what makes the location special. This section is designed to inform visitors about exciting places to visit.

- **Hotels Section**: Similar to the destinations section, the hotels section showcases featured hotels. Each hotel is presented with an image, a name (such as "The Ritz Carlton"), and a brief description of what makes the hotel luxurious or desirable. The goal is to encourage visitors to consider booking these hotels for their trips.

- **Closing Tags**: The document ends with the closing `</body>` and `</html>` tags, marking the end of the webpage content and the HTML document itself.

### CSS Styling

CSS is used to style the website, making it look visually appealing and ensuring that the design is responsive (adapts to different screen sizes).

- **Basic Layout and Spacing**: The website uses a universal rule (`* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }`) to remove default margins and padding from all elements, creating a clean slate for custom styling. Flexbox and grid layout systems are used to arrange elements like the navigation menu, destinations, and hotels.

- **Logo and Navigation Menu**: The logo section is styled to ensure that the logo fits well on the page. The navigation menu items are arranged horizontally using Flexbox, and the links are styled with a larger font size, bold text, and a smooth hover effect. When the user hovers over a link, its color changes to a red shade to indicate interactivity.

- **Hero Section**: The hero section is styled to be large and eye-catching, with a background image and centered text. The "Book Now" button is given a bright background color, and it changes to a darker shade when hovered over to provide a visual cue for interaction.

- **Destinations and Hotels Sections**: The destinations and hotels are presented in a grid layout, where each destination or hotel is displayed in its own card with an image, title, and description. The images are set to cover the container's area without stretching, making sure they look good in all screen sizes. The sections also have a large title and clear text that makes the information easy to read.

- **Responsive Design**: Media queries are used to adjust the layout on smaller screens, such as mobile phones. For example, the navigation menu changes from a horizontal layout to a vertical layout, and the destination grid switches from three columns to one column. This ensures that the website remains easy to use and looks good on devices with smaller screens.

### Key Concepts for Beginners

1. **HTML Structure**: HTML is used to create the content of the website, such as text, images, and links. It provides the foundation of the website.

2. **CSS Styling**: CSS is used to design the website, controlling the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects. It makes the website look attractive and ensures it functions well on different devices.

3. **Responsive Design**: Using media queries, the website adjusts its layout depending on the screen size. This ensures that the website is mobile-friendly and looks good on any device, whether itâ€™s a large desktop monitor or a small phone screen.

4. **Layout Systems**: Flexbox and Grid are used to control the layout of elements. Flexbox is great for arranging items in a row or column, while Grid allows for more complex arrangements of content.

5. **Interactivity**: Links and buttons are styled with hover effects to make the website more interactive. These effects guide users and make the website feel more engaging.
